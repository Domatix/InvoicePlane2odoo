InvoicePlane to Odoo
====================

This module allows you to create partners, sale orders and invoices from JSON files generated by your invoiceplane server.

Requirements
============

* Download from your invoiceplane control panel the tables you want to migrate.

* Before upload the data, you will need to remove all the comments of your JSON file.

Usage
=====

InvoicePlane -> Import Data

Posible tables:

 * ip_clients -> Create Partners
 * ip_quotes -> Create Sale Orders
 * ip_quotes_items -> Create Sale Order Lines
 * ip_invoices -> Create Invoices
 * ip_invoice_items -> Create Invoice Lines
 
Once the import is complete, you can see what was imported going to InvoicePlane -> Data imported
